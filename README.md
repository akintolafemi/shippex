# shippex

## Project Name

shippex

## Description

This project is built using [React Native](http://reactnative.dev) & [Expo](http://docs.expo.dev). It is a simple shipment tracking app using React Native, which allows drivers to manage their shipment status.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn

## Clone Repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/akintolafemi/shippex.git
```

## Set up Environment

No enviroment set up is needed

## Installation

cd into the project folder on your PC and run the command below

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npx expo start
```

## Login Credentials

There is no real authentication implemented. So any random text for both email and password fields would work.

## Asumptions

The following assumptions were made while implementing

1. Username/Email field is allowed to take any string as username is not exactly an email address. This could be combination of both number and string
2. No API calls are made, the shipments list is populated with a dummy hardcoded data
